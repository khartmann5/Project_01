## Project Description/Outline:
Looking at air quality during certain events such as the fires of 2020. Using OpenAQ API, and other government sources, comparing different cities during the fires and general qir quality over time. Looking at particulates and carbon monoxide.  Track over time air quality changes looking at the certain elements (particulates and carbon monoxide). Also, looking from March 2020 to present at why the air quality may have changed. Did the shutdown correlate with a increase in air quality? Less people on the roads contibuting to less air pollution? What areas of the globe experienced the most impact with COVID shut downs?

## Next steps
Looking at the air quality data set and combing with citipy to get a list of cities that we want to focus on.
