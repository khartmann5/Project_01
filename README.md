## Project Description/Outline:
Looking at air quality and its relationship to population density and access to public transportation and weather patterns.  

## Possible Questions to Answer : 
-Is there a direct relationship between population density and air quality?
-How does use of Public Transportation play a part in air quality, does higher usage of Public Transportation equate to better air quality?
-Do areas with a smaller population but also less access to Public Transportation have comparible air quality to an area with a higher population?
-How do weather patterns play a part?
-Do hotter dryer areas have a worse air quality despite their population and access to public transportation?
-Do colder and wetter areas have better air quality despite their population and access to public transportation?



## Next steps
Research the air quality data set and combing with citipy to get a list of cities that we want to focus on. What kind of data do we have to work with?  
- 2/1 Next Steps: Chris to pull the dataset from the API to know the data we will be working with to help us determine our specific questions to answer. 
- 2/5 : Met with the team to determine a better direction of questions and a hypothesis to determine.  Found better data sets to work with and determined that population/air quality/transportation and weather patterns all can be tracked and could have a direct effect on each other.
- 2/6 : narrowing down the cities to focus on and looking for patterns
